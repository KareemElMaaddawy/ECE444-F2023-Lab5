# What are the pros and cons of TDD?
Pros:
- **Faster Debugging**: Since the code is written based on tests, it is much easier to identfy where the code went wrong. This makes it easier to to fix them due to the availability of a suite of tests pre-hand

- **Tests document the code**: The tests themselves act as a way of documenting the code by showing the ways it is supposed to be used. It can be thought of a sample code showing the various inputs and outputs expected.

- **Easier for incremental developmenty**: Test-driven-development encourages one to build the software incrementally in an orderly manner. Helps break larger functions into smaller sub-functions to build up a system.

Cons:
- **Initial overhead**: Due to the fact that tests are neededto be written to drive the code devlopment, this adds more overhead to the developer who is required to write the test first which requires more effort and time upfront.

- **Overemphasis on testing**: Developers may get too focused on just simply passing the tests which comprimises on overrall software design.

- **Tests need to be maintained**: If the requirements are changed, the tests also need to be changed to reflect this.
